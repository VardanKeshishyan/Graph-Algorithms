Graph Algorithms:

This project implements graph algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Kruskalâ€™s algorithm for computing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). It also includes an efficient Union-Find data structure with path compression to support Kruskal's algorithm.

Examples of BFS and DFS:
